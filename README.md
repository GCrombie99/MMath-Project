# MMath-Project
Repository containing MATLAB code that I have written for my MMath project. 

SwitchingVaccinationRate.m, SIRODE.m, SIRODE2.m, VaxEvent1.m and VaxEvent2.m are all already shown in the appendix for my project. This code produces a plot for the model with a switching vaccination rate. 

Proposition2part1a.m corresponds to figures 4.1 and 4.4 in my MMath project. This code requires deltanat.m, deltaint.m and TerminateNat2.m in order to run. Proposition2part1b.m corresponds to figures 4.2 and 4.5. It is identical to Proposition2part1a.m appart from a different value of Inat. Proposition2Part2.m corresponds to figures 4.3 and 4.6, and requires the same files to run as Proposition2part1a.m, with the addition of Vdash.m. 

Proposition2poincarepart2.m was used for the MATLAB outputs for table 4.1. The files also needed to run this one are deltaint.m, Vax2Part2.m, deltanat.m and Vax1.m.
