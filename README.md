# MMath-Project
Repository containing MATLAB code that I have written for my MMath project. 

SwitchingVaccinationRate.m, SIRODE.m, SIRODE2.m, VaxEvent1.m and VaxEvent2.m are all already shown in the appendix for my project. This code produces a plot for the model with a switching vaccination rate. 

Proposition2part1a.m corresponds to figures 4.1 and 4.4 in my MMath project. Proposition2part1b.m corresponds to figures 4.2 and 4.5, and Proposition2Part2.m corresponds to figures 4.3 and 4.6. 

Proposition2poincarepart2.m was used for the MATLAB outputs for table 4.1.
